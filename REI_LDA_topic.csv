In fact, they were built to exclude us. 

The relationships communities of color have with nature are often different. Being outdoors is often associated to labor and exploitation, not joy and relaxation. This, coupled with the unequal access to green spaces and safe running paths, perpetuates ideas that BIPOC individuals do not belong in the running community. The lack of access to safe running paths and trails is an environmental racism issue.

Road running is an accessible and close-to-home way to reacquaint yourself with nature. Simply noticing the weather changes, the local trees in your neighborhood, and the sounds and smells can fill these spaces with joy.

Not sure where to start? Find a community that creates safe spaces for learning. Tune into REI’s initiatives to expand who belongs in this space through their free resources including virtual appointments, blogs, and local running events.""

With the help of @rei, I am embracing this setback and regaining my love for road running. 
⠀ ⠀ ⠀
I've hit the pavement again with the help of a new pair of @on_running Cloudrunners (now available @rei). As I am still not quite back to 100%, I needed to find a new pair of runners with *extra* cushioning to take the impact out of running on hard surfaces … like the pavement between the front door and my favorite coffee shop. With a midsole made from CloudTec® cushioning in ultraliaht Zero-Gravity foam, these shoes have allowed me to make some progress the past few weeks—from short walks to slow jogs to runs to a few of my favorite neighborhoods (and iconic bridges) in the city.
⠀ ⠀ ⠀
Head to rei.com to schedule a Virtual Outfitting session and let a certified running coach help you find the right pair of shoes for your foot. If you have really high arches and a narrow foot—or just need a little extra cushion like me—Cloudrunners may be the perfect choice for you, too.""
